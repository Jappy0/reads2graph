## Example

### Installing reads2graph from source codes
```
cd ..
cd example
../bin/reads2graph -i ./data/SRR1543965.umi.fasta -o ./ -x 2 -n 1 -p 64 -k 4 --window_number 2 --omh_times 4 --omh_k 4
```
### Installing reads2graph from bioconda
download the example data(SRR1543965.umi.fasta) from this repo
```
wget https://github.com/Jappy0/reads2graph/blob/main/example/data/SRR1543965.umi.fasta
```
```
reads2graph -i ./data/SRR1543965.umi.fasta -o ./ -x 2 -n 1 -p 64 -k 4 --window_number 2 --omh_times 4 --omh_k 4
```
### Expected results
Note: the date and time will be the real date and time when you run reads2graph
